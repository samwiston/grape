grape - gray's tape drive enhancement suite

# What is this

grape is a program that operates on top of Computronic's Tape Drive API. Right now it allows for easy seeking of cassette tapes, instantaneous rewinds, and a monitor program that will make connected tape drives operate as "smart" tape drives, i.e. it will auto insta-rewind when tapes finish and when you press rewind on a tape drive.
